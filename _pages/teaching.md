## EE 310 Electronic Circuit Design I

In this course, we learn about the electrical properties of different fundamental semiconductor devices and their basic circuit design applications. This course deals explicitly with both linear and nonlinear applications of devices, and with the practical aspects of design such as the inherently nonlinear nature of semiconductor devices. The analysis concepts introduced in your previous network course are utilized and advanced in their treatment of nonlinear devices. In the laboratory, we put the theory into practice.

## EE 442 Solid State Devices

The lecture provides learning opportunities that should enable the students to do the following upon completion of this course:

1. Develop a basic understanding of the following key concepts in quantum and statistical mechanics relevant to the physical properties of electronic materials and their device applications:
   - Quantum mechanics
   - Statistical mechanics
   - Equilibrium vs non-equilibrium properties
   - P-N junctions
   - Photodetectors
   - MOS field effect transistors
2. Become proficient with fundamental device physics concepts.
3. Learn to analyze device characteristics in detail and brainstorm ways towards improving them or adapting them to new applications for a sustainable digital future.

## EE 597 Micro & Nano Medical Devices

This course aims to provide a comprehensive foundation in the theory and application of micro- and nanoscale medical devices. The objectives are:

1. Introduce fundamental concepts in the design and fabrication of micro- and nanoscale MEMS, fluidics, and lab-on-a-chip systems.
2. Provide exposure to clinically relevant applications, particularly in the area of point-of-care diagnostics.
3. Teach students how to conduct literature reviews, write, and evaluate research proposals.
4. Familiarize students with the medical device industry and related regulations.
