	abstract = {There is a significant demand for multiplexed fluorescence sensing and detection across a range of applications. Yet, the development of portable and compact multiplexable systems remains a substantial challenge. This difficulty largely stems from the inherent need for spectrum separation, which typically requires sophisticated and expensive optical components. Here, we demonstrate a compact, lens-free, and cost-effective fluorescence sensing setup that incorporates machine learning for scalable multiplexed fluorescence detection. This method utilizes low-cost optical components and a pretrained machine learning (ML) model to enable multiplexed fluorescence sensing without optical adjustments. Its multiplexing capability can be easily scaled up through updates to the machine learning model without altering the hardware. We demonstrate its real-world application in a probe-based multiplexed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay designed to simultaneously detect three common respiratory viruses within a single reaction. The effectiveness of this approach highlights the system’s potential for point-of-care applications that require cost-effective and scalable solutions. The machine learning-enabled multiplexed fluorescence sensing demonstrated in this work would pave the way for widespread adoption in diverse settings, from clinical laboratories to field diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Regular, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive self-testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is urgently needed to quell pandemic propagation. The existing at-home nucleic acid testing (NAT) test has high sensitivity and specificity, but it requires users to mail the sample to the central lab, which often takes 3−5 days to obtain the results. On the other hand, rapid antigen tests for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen provide a fast sample to answer the test (15 min). However, the sensitivity of antigen tests is 30 to 40\% lower than nucleic acid testing, which could miss a significant portion of infected patients. Here, we developed a fully integrated SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) device using a self-collected saliva sample. This platform can automatically handle the complexity and can perform the functions, including (1) virus particles’ thermal lysis preparation, (2) sample dispensing, (3) target sequence RT-LAMP amplification, (4) real-time detection, and (5) result report and communication. With a turnaround time of less than 45 min, our device achieved the limit of detection (LoD) of 5 copies/μL of the saliva sample, which is comparable with the LoD (6 copies/μL) using FDA-approved quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays with the same heat-lysis saliva sample preparation method. With clinical samples, our platform showed a good agreement with the results from the gold-standard RT-PCR method. These results show that our platform can perform self-administrated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by laypersons with noninvasive saliva samples. We believe that our self-testing platform will have an ongoing benefit for COVID-19 control and fighting future pandemics.},

Existing HIV self-testing methods rely on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect the presence of HIV-1/2 antibodies, which could miss a significant portion of asymptomatic carriers during the window period. In this work, we present a fully integrated nucleic acid testing (NAT) device towards streamlined HIV self-testing using 100 μL finger-prick whole blood. The device consists of a ready-to-use microfluidic reagent cartridge and an ultra-compact NAT-on-USB analyzer. The test requires simple steps from the user to drop the finger-prick blood sample into a collection tube with lysis buffer and load the lysate onto the microfluidic cartridge, and the testing result can be easily read out by a custom-built graphical user interface (GUI). The microfluidic cartridge and the analyzer automatically handle the complexity of sample preparation, purification, and real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). With a turnaround time of {\textasciitilde}60 min, we achieved a limit of detection (LoD) of 214 viral RNA copies/ mL of whole blood at a 95\% confidence level.

Rapid and accurate testing of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed for early detection and control of the disease spread. Here, we present an RT-LAMP coupled glass nanopore digital counting method for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. We validated and compared two one-pot RT-LAMP assays targeting nucleocapsid (N) and envelop (E) genes. The nucleocapsid assay was adopted due to its quick time to positive and better copy number sensitivity. For qualitative positive/negative classification of a testing sample, we used the glass nanopore to digitally count the RT-LAMP amplicons and benchmarked the event rate with a threshold. Due to its intrinsic single molecule sensitivity, nanopore sensors could capture the amplification dynamics more rapidly (quick time to positive). We validated our RT-LAMP coupled glass nanopore digital counting method for SARS-CoV-2 detection by using both spiked saliva samples and COVID-19 clinical naso­ pharyngeal swab samples. The results obtained showed excellent agreement with the gold standard RT-PCR assay. With its integration capability, the electronic nanopore digital counting platform has significant poten­ tial to provide a rapid, sensitive, and specific point-of-care assay for SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {Laser-assisted controlled dielectric breakdown (LaCBD) has emerged as an alternative to conventional CBD-based nanopore fabrication due to its localization capability, facilitated by the photothermal-induced thinning down in the hot spot. Here, we reported the potential impact of the laser on forming debris around the nanopore region in LaCBD. The debris was clearly observable by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. We found that debris formation is a unique phenomenon in LaCBD that is not observable in the conventional CBD approach. We also found that the LaCBD-induced debris is more evident when the laser power and voltage stress are higher. Moreover, the debris is asymmetrically distributed on the top and bottom sides of the membrane. We also found unexpected rectified ionic and molecular transport in those LaCBD nanopores with debris. Based on these observations, we developed and validated a model describing the debris formation kinetics in LaCBD by considering the generation, diffusion, drift, and gravity in viscous mediums. These findings indicate that while laser aids in nanopore localization, precautions should be taken due to the potential formation of debris and rectification of molecular transport. This study provides valuable insights into the kinetics of LaCBD and the characteristics of the LaCBD nanopore.},

	abstract = {Quantification of HIV RNA in plasma is critical for identifying the disease progression and monitoring the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. While RT-qPCR has been the gold standard for HIV viral load quantification, digital assays could provide an alternative calibration-free absolute quantification method. Here, we reported a Self-digitization Through Automated Membrane-based Partitioning (STAMP) method to digitalize the CRISPR-Cas13 assay (dCRISPR) for amplification-free and absolute quantification of HIV-1 viral RNAs. The HIV-1 Cas13 assay was designed, validated, and optimized. We evaluated the analytical performances with synthetic RNAs. With a membrane that partitions ∼100 nL of reaction mixture (effectively containing 10 nL of input RNA sample), we showed that RNA samples spanning 4 orders of dynamic range between 1 fM (∼6 RNAs) to 10 pM (∼60k RNAs) could be quantified as fast as 30 min. We also examined the end-to-end performance from RNA extraction to STAMP-dCRISPR quantification using 140 μL of both spiked and clinical plasma samples. We demonstrated that the device has a detection limit of approximately 2000 copies/mL and can resolve a viral load change of 3571 copies/mL (equivalent to 3 RNAs in a single membrane) with 90\% confidence. Finally, we evaluated the device using 140 μL of 20 patient plasma samples (10 positives and 10 negatives) and benchmarked the performance with RT-PCR. The STAMP-dCRISPR results agree very well with RT-PCR for all negative and high positive samples with Ct {\textless} 32. However, the STAMP-dCRISPR is limited in detecting low positive samples with Ct {\textgreater} 32 due to the subsampling errors. Our results demonstrated a digital Cas13 platform that could offer an accessible amplificationfree quantification of viral RNAs. By further addressing the subsampling issue with approaches such as preconcentration, this platform could be further exploited for quantitatively determining viral load for an array of infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant problem to consider as it can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Fortunately, AIDS is manageable through antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, frequent viral load monitoring is needed to monitor the effectiveness of the therapy. The current reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) viral load monitoring is highly effective, but is challenged by being resource-intensive and inaccessible, and its turnaround time does not meet demand. An unmet need exists for an affordable, rapid, and user-friendly point-of-care device that could revolutionize and ensure therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in resource-limited settings. In this work, we explored a pointof-care HIV viral load device to address this need. This device can perform streamlined plasma separation, viral RNA extraction, and real-time reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) semiquantitative testing in an ultracompact device. We developed an absorption-based membrane plasma separation method suitable for finger-prick blood samples, achieving an efficiency of 80\%. We also designed a syringe-based RNA extraction method for on-site plasma processing with a viral recovery efficiency of 86\%. We created a portable device with a smartphone interface for real-time semiquantitative RT-LAMP, which is useful for monitoring viral load. The device uses lyophilized reagents, processed with our lyophilization method, which remain stable for 16 weeks. The device can accurately categorize viral load into low, medium, and high categories with 95\% accuracy. We believe this point-of-care HIV self-test device, offering convenience and longterm storage, could aid patients in home-based ART treatment monitoring.},

	abstract = {In developing solid-state nanopore sensors for single molecule detection, comprehensive evaluation of the nanopore quality is important. Existing studies typically rely on comparing the noise root mean square or power spectrum density values. Nanopores exhibiting lower noise values are generally considered superior. This evaluation is valid when the single molecule signal remains consistent. However, the signal can vary, as it is strongly related to the solid-state nanopore size, which is hard to control during fabrication consistently. This work emphasized the need to report the baseline current for evaluating solid-state nanopore sensors. The baseline current offers insight into several experimental conditions, particularly the nanopore size. Our experiments show that a nanopore sensor with more noise is not necessarily worse when considering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), particularly when the pore size is smaller. Our findings suggest that relying only on noise comparisons can lead to inaccurate evaluations of solid-state nanopore sensors, considering the inherent variability in fabrication and testing setups among labs and measurements. We propose that future studies should include reporting baseline current and sensing conditions. Additionally, using SNR as a primary evaluation tool for nanopore sensors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their performance.},

To date, POCTs for BCC were mainly achieved by “stationary” images through blood smears or single-laity arranged cells in the microwell, making it difficult to obtain statistically sufficient numbers of cells. In this work, we present a fully integrated POCT device solely using “in-flow” imaging of 3 μL fingertip whole blood for improved identification and counting accuracy of BCC analysis. A miniaturized magnetic stirring module was integrated to maintain the temporal stability of cell concentration. A relatively high throughput ({\textasciitilde}8000 cells/min) with a 30-fold dilution ratio of whole blood can be tested for as long as 1 h to examine sufficient numbers of cells, and the subclass cell concentration keeps constant. To improve the identification accuracy, multi-frame “in-flow” imaging was used to track the cell motion trails with multi-angle morphology analysis. This proof-of-concept was then validated with healthy whole blood samples and 75 cases of clinical patients with abnormal concentrations of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLT). The average precision (AP) value of WBCs identification was improved from 0.8622 to 0.9934 using the multi-frame analysis method. And the high fitting degrees ({\textgreater}0.98) between our POCT device and the commercial clinical equipment indicated good agreement. This POCT device is user-friendly and cost-effective, making it a potential tool for diagnosing abnormal blood cell morphology or concentration in the field setting.},

          , 
            
              Upstream sample preparation remains the bottleneck for point-of-need nucleic acid testing due to its complexity and time-consuming nature. Sample preparation involves extracting, purifying, and concentrating nucleic acids from various matrices. These processes are critical for ensuring the accuracy and sensitivity of downstream nucleic acid amplification and detection. However, current sample preparation methods are often laboratory-based, requiring specialized equipment, trained personnel, and several hours of processing time. As a result, sample preparation often limits the speed, portability, and cost-effectiveness of point-of-need nucleic acid testing. A universal, field-deployable sample preparation device is highly desirable for this critical need and unmet challenge. Here we reported a handheld, battery-powered, reconfigurable, and field-deployable nucleic acid sample preparation device. A programmable electromagnetic actuator was developed to drive a magnetic robot (ProMagBot) in
              X
              /
              Y
              2D space, such that various magnetic bead-based sample preparations can be readily translated from the laboratory to point-of-need settings. The control of the electromagnetic actuator requires only a 3-phase unipolar voltage in
              X
              and
              Y
              directions, and therefore, the motion space is highly scalable. We validated the ProMagBot device with a model application by extracting HIV viral RNAs from plasma samples using two widely used magnetic bead kits: ChargeSwitch and MagMAX beads. In both cases, the ProMagBot could successfully extract viral RNAs from 50 μL plasma samples containing as low as 10
              2
              copies of viral RNAs in 20 minutes. Our results demonstrated the ability of ProMagBot to prepare samples from complex mediums at the point of need. We believe such a device would enable rapid and robust sample preparation in various settings, including resource-limited or remote environments, and accelerate the development of next-generation point-of-need nucleic acid testing.},

	abstract = {Digital CRISPR (dCRISPR) assays are an emerging platform of molecular diagnostics. Digital platforms introduce absolute quantiﬁcation and increased sensitivity to bulk CRISPR assays. With ultra-speciﬁc targeting, isothermal operation, and rapid detection, dCRISPR systems are well-prepared to lead the ﬁeld of molecular diagnostics. Here we summarized the common Cas proteins used in CRISPR detection assays. The methods of digital detection and critical performance factors are examined. We formed three strategies to frame the landscape of dCRISPR systems: (1) ampliﬁcation free, (2) in-partition ampliﬁcation, and (3) two-stage ampliﬁcation. We also compared the performance of all systems through the limit of detection (LOD), testing time, and ﬁgure of merit (FOM). This work summarizes the details of digital CRISPR platforms to guide future development. We envision that improvements to LOD and dynamic range will position dCRISPR as the leading platform for the next generation of molecular biosensing.},

	abstract = {Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method for developing point-ofcare nucleic acid testing due to its isothermal nature. Yet, LAMP can suffer from the issue of false positives, which can compromise the specificity of the results. LAMP false positives typically arise due to contamination, nonspecific amplification, and nonspecific signal reporting (intercalating dyes, colorimetric, turbidity, etc.). While dye-labeled primers or probes have been introduced for multiplexed detection and enhanced specificity in LAMP assays, they carry the risk of reaction inhibition. This inhibition can result from the labeled primers with fluorophores or quenchers and probes that do not fully dissociate during reaction. This work demonstrated a nanopore-based system for probe-free LAMP readouts by employing amplicon sizing and counting, analogous to an electronic version of gel electrophoresis. We first developed a model to explore LAMP kinetics and verified distinct patterns between true and false positives via gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, we implemented nanopore sized counting and calibrated the event charge deficit (ECD) values and frequencies to ensure a fair analysis of amplicon profiles. This sized counting method, integrated with machine learning, achieved 91.67\% accuracy for false positive discrimination, enhancing LAMP’s reliability for nucleic acid detection.},

            Solid‐state nanopore sensors, a type of resistive pulse sensing, achieve optimal signal‐to‐noise performance with a single nanopore. However, the processes involved in solid‐state nanopore fabrication and subsequent measurements frequently lead to the formation of multiple nanopores, posing a challenge for precise detection. To address this issue, here, a novel and expedient technique to verify the presence of a single nanopore on a chip is developed. The methodology includes measuring the nanopore's conductance in solutions of various salt conditions, followed by a comparison of these results against a theoretical conductance model. This comparison is instrumental in distinguishing between single and multiple nanopores. Additionally, the study delves into various factors that influence the conductance curve, such as deviations in pore shape from the standard circle and inconsistencies in pore diameter. This approach significantly enhances the practical application of low‐cost nanopore preparation techniques, particularly in scenarios like controlled breakdown nanopore fabrication, where the formation of multiple nanopores is a common concern.},

	abstract = {Monkeypox virus (MPXV) poses a global health emergency, necessitating rapid, simple, and accurate detection to manage its spread effectively. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) tech­ nique has emerged as a promising next-generation molecular diagnostic approach. Here, we developed a highly sensitive and specific CRISPR-Cas12a assisted nanopore (SCAN) with isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for MPXV detection. The RPA-SCAN method offers a sensitivity unachievable with unam­ plified SCAN while also addressing the obstacles of PCR-SCAN for point-of-care applications. We demonstrated that size-counting of single molecules enables analysis of reaction-time dependent distribution of the cleaved reporter. Our MPXV-specific RPA assay achieved a limit of detection (LoD) of 19 copies in a 50 μL reaction system. By integrating 2 μL of RPA amplifications into a 20 μL CRISPR reaction, we attained an overall LoD of 16 copies/μL (26.56 aM) of MPXV at a 95\% confidence level using the SCAN sensor. We also verified the specificity of RPA-SCAN in distinguishing MPXV from cowpox virus with 100\% accuracy. These findings suggest that the isothermal RPA-SCAN device is well-suited for highly sensitive and specific Monkeypox detection. Given its electronic nature and miniaturization potential, the RPA-SCAN system paves the way for diagnosing a wide array of other infectious pathogens at the point of care.},

Salivary miRNA, in particular, stands out for its non-invasive collection method and ease of accessibility, offering promising avenues for the development of point-of-care diagnostics for a spectrum of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. Such development promises rapid and precise diagnosis, enabling timely treatment. Despite significant advancements in salivary miRNA-based testing, challenges persist in the quantification, multiplexing, sensitivity, and specificity, particularly for miRNA at low concentrations in complex biological mixtures. This work delves into these challenges, focusing on the development and application of salivary miRNA tests for point-of-care use. We explore the biogenesis of salivary miRNA and analyze their quantitative expression and their disease relevance in cancer, infection, and neurodegenerative disorders. We also examined recent progress in miRNA extraction, amplification, and multiplexed detection methods. This study offers a comprehensive view of the development of salivary miRNA-based point-of-care testing (POCT).

We investigated (i) a ﬂexible bonded string of charged beads and (ii) a ssDNA polymer of variable length, for various trap parameters. A line charge undergoes oscillations or rotations as it moves, depending on its initial angle, the position of the center of mass and the velocity. The stability region for a strongly bonded line of charged beads is similar to that of a single ion with the same charge to mass ratio. Single stranded DNA as long as 40 nm does not fold or curl in the Paul trap, but could undergo rotations about the center of mass.

Here we report the electric ﬁeld modulation of the membrane potential phenomena in mechanically and chemically robust solid-state ion channels, an abiotic analogue to the voltage-gated ion channels in living systems. To understand the complex physicochemical processes in the electric ﬁeld regulated membrane potential behavior, both quasi-static and transient characteristics of converting transmembrane ion gradients into electric potential are investigated. It is found that the transmembrane potential can be adequately tuned by an external electrical stimulation, thanks to the unique properties of the voltage-regulated selective ion transport through a nanoscale channel.},

              In response to the urgent need of a field-deployable and highly sensitive malaria diagnosis, we developed a standalone, “sample-in-answer-out” molecular diagnostic system (AnyMDx) to enable quantitative molecular analysis of blood-borne malaria in low resource areas. The system consists of a durable battery-powered analyzer and a disposable microfluidic compact disc loaded with reagents ready for use. A low power thermal module and a novel fluorescence-sensing module are integrated into the analyzer for real-time monitoring of loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) of target parasite DNA. With 10 μL of raw blood sample, the AnyMDx system automates the nucleic acid sample preparation and subsequent LAMP and real-time detection. Under laboratory conditions with whole-blood samples spiked with cultured
              Plasmodium falciparum
              , we achieved a detection limit of ∼0.6 parasite per μL, much lower than those for the conventional microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (∼50–100 parasites per μL). The turnaround time from sample to answer is less than 40 minutes. The AnyMDx is user-friendly requiring minimal technological training. The analyzer and the disposable reagent compact discs are cost-effective, making AnyMDx a potential tool for malaria molecular diagnosis under field settings for malaria elimination.},

The cell deformability is measured by evaluating the transit time when each individual RBC squeezes through a microscale constriction (cross-section {\textasciitilde}5 µm×5 µm). More than 30,000 RBCs can be analyzed for parasitemia quantiﬁcation in under 1 min with a throughput {\textasciitilde}500 cells/s.

              As the technical performance and reliability of white organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) begin to mature, broader adoption in the lighting market will increasingly rely on exploiting the unique aesthetic opportunities that OLEDs afford. Here, kirigami‐based concepts that enable ultraflexible thin film OLEDs to be cut, folded, and “popped up” into a variety of 3D shapes ranging from globes to candle flame mimics are used. It is demonstrated that large area ({\textgreater}15 cm
              2
              ) OLEDs fabricated and encapsulated on sub‐50 µm thick polyimide films can be cut and folded into 3D with negligible impact on their efficiency and electrical characteristics. These results point to an alternate paradigm for OLED lighting that moves beyond traditional 2D panels toward 3D designs that deliver unique and creative new opportunities for lighting.},

We report a real-time ﬂuorescence nucleic acid testing device for malaria ﬁeld detection with automated and scalable sample preparation capability. The device consists a compact analyzer and a disposable microﬂuidic reagent compact disc. The parasite DNA sample preparation and subsequent realtime LAMP detection were seamlessly integrated on a single microﬂuidic compact disc, driven by energy eﬃcient non-centrifuge based magnetic ﬁeld interactions. Each disc contains four parallel testing units which could be conﬁgured either as four identical tests or as four species-speciﬁc tests. When conﬁgured as species-speciﬁc tests, it could identify two of the most life-threatening malaria species (P. falciparum and P. vivax). The NAT device is capable of processing four samples simultaneously within 50 min turnaround time. It achieves a detection limit of {\textasciitilde}0.5 parasites/µl for whole blood, suﬃcient for detecting asymptomatic parasite carriers. The combination of the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, cost, and scalable sample preparation suggests the real-time ﬂuorescence LAMP device could be particularly useful for malaria screening in the ﬁeld settings.},

Existing theories and experiments have shown that sample concentration is proportional to the molecule translocation rate. However, a detailed nanopore geometry and size characterization or a calibration curve of concentration standards are often required for quantifying the unknown sample. In this work, we proposed and validated a calibration-free nanopore single molecule digital counting method for isolated molecule quantiﬁcation. With the background ions as the in situ references, the molecule translocation rates can be normalized to the ion translocation rates (i.e., baseline current). This in situ reference alleviates the requirement for knowing the nanopore geometry and size or generating a calibration curve. In recognition of this eﬀect, we developed a quantitative model for nanopore quantiﬁcation without the need for prior knowledge of experimental conditions such as nanopore geometry, size, and applied voltage. This model was experimentally validated for diﬀerent nanopores and DNA molecules with diﬀerent sizes. We anticipate this calibration-free digital counting approach would provide a new avenue for nanopore-based molecule sensing.},

This issue is more pronounced when the analyte concentration is below the nanomolar (nM) range, owing to the diﬀusion-limited mass transport. In this work, we systematically studied the experimental factors beyond the intrinsic analyte concentration and electrophoretic mobility that aﬀect the event rate in glass nanopore sensors. We developed a quantitative model to capture the impact of nanopore surface charge density, ionic strength, nanopore geometry, and translocation direction on the event rate. The synergistic eﬀects of these factors on the event rates were investigated with the aim to ﬁnd the optimized experimental conditions for operating the glass nanopore sensor from the response time standpoint. The ﬁndings in the study would provide useful and practical insight to enhance the device response time and achieve a lower detection limit for various glass nanopore-sensing experiments.},

In response, by combining the time-division multiple access technique in the telecommunication ﬁeld with the microﬂuidics, we reported a microﬂuidic time-division multiplexing accessing (TDMA) singleend resistive pulse sensor, in which particles can be analyzed through a scalable number of microﬂuidic channels. With an eight-channel microﬂuidic device and polystyrene particles as proof-of-principle, we successfully demonstrated this multiplexed technology is eﬀective in measuring the particle size and concentration, in analyzing the particle arriving dynamics, and in discriminating mixed populations. Importantly, the availability of multiple sensing pores provides a robust mechanism to overcome the clogging issue, allowing the analysis to continue even when some of the pores are clogged. We anticipate this TDMA approach could ﬁnd wide applications and facilitate future development of multiplexed resistive pulse sensing from the microscale to nanoscale.},

	abstract = {Solid-state nanopores have shown great promise and achieved tremendous success in label-free single-molecule analysis. However, there are three common challenges in solid-state nanopore sensors, including the nanopore size variations from batch to batch that makes the interpretation of the sensing results diﬃcult, the incorporation of sensor speciﬁcity, and the impractical analysis time at low analyte concentration due to diﬀusion-limited mass transport. Here, we demonstrate a novel loopmediated isothermal ampliﬁcation (LAMP)-coupled glass nanopore counting strategy that could eﬀectively address these challenges. By using the glass nanopore in the counting mode (versus the sizing mode), the device fabrication challenge is considerably eased since it allows a certain degree of pore size variations and no surface functionalization is needed. The speciﬁc molecule replication eﬀectively breaks the diﬀusion-limited mass transport thanks to the exponential growth of the target molecules. We show the LAMPcoupled glass nanopore counting has the potential to be used in a qualitative test as well as in a quantitative nucleic acid test. This approach lends itself to most ampliﬁcation strategies as long as the target template is speciﬁcally replicated in numbers. The highly sensitive and speciﬁc sensing strategy would open a new avenue for solid-state nanopore sensors toward a new form of compact, rapid, low-cost nucleic acid testing at the point of care.},

Robust and deterministic detection of initial physical breakdown to alleviate false positives and false negatives is critical for precise nanopore size control. To this end, we report a high ﬁdelity moving Z-score method based CBD fabrication of solid-state nanopore.

When a single particle translocated across an array of sensing pores, multiple time-related resistive pulse signals were generated. Due to the time correlation of these resistive pulse signals, we found a multiple crosscorrelation analysis (MCCA) could enhance the sizing signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio by a factor of n1/2, where n is the pore numbers in series. This proof-of-concept is experimentally validated with polystyrene beads as well as human red blood cells.

It integrates the transit-time-based deformability measurement and active hydrodynamic sorting onto a single chip. We identiﬁed the critical factors that affect the sorting dynamics by modeling and experimental approaches. We found that the device throughput is determined by the summation of the sensing, buffering, and sorting time. A total time of {\textasciitilde}100 ms is used for analyzing and sorting a single particle, leading to a throughput of 600 particles/min. We synthesized poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel beads as the deformability model for device validation and performance evaluation. A deformability-activated sorting purity of 88\% and an average efﬁciency of 73\% were achieved.

In this work, we demonstrate the use of confocal scanning photoluminescence (PL) for mapping the microscopic changes in SiNx nanopores when exposed to electron and laser beams. We developed and validated a model for the quantitative interpretation of the scanned PL result. The model shows that the scanning PL result is insensitive to the nanopore size. Instead, it is dominated by the product of two microscopic material factors: quantum yield profile (i.e. variations in electronic structure) and thickness profile (i.e. thinning of the membrane). We experimentally demonstrated that the electron and laser beams could alter the material electronic structures (i.e. quantum yield) even when no thinning of the membrane occurs. Our results suggest that minimizing the unintended e-beam or laser beam to the SiNx during the fabrication is crucial if one desires the microscopic integrity of the membrane.},

	abstract = {Controlled molecular transport and separation is of signiﬁcant importance in various applications. In this work, we presented a novel concept of nanoﬂuidic molecular charge-coupled device (CCD) for controlled DNA transport and separation. By leveraging the unique ﬁeld-effect coupling in nanoﬂuidic systems, the nanoﬂuidic molecular CCD aims to store charged biomolecules such as DNAs in discrete regions in nanochannels and transfer and separate these biomolecules as a charge packet in a bucket brigade fashion. We developed a quantitative model to capture the impact of nanochannel surface charge, gating voltage and frequency, molecule diffusivity, and gating electrode geometry on the transport and separation efﬁciency. We studied the synergistic effects of these factors to guide the device design and optimize the DNA transport and separation in a nanoﬂuidic CCD. The ﬁndings in this study provided insight into the rational design and implementation of the nanoﬂuidic molecular CCD.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 caused the disease COVID-19 to spread globally. Speciﬁc and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates early intervention and prevents the disease from spreading. Here, we present a solid-state CRISPR-Cas12aassisted nanopore (SCAN) sensing strategy for the speciﬁc detection of SARS-CoV-2. We introduced a nanopore-sized counting method to measure the cleavage ratio of reporters, which is used as a criterion for positive/negative classiﬁcation. A kinetic cleavage model was developed and validated to predict the reporter size distributions. The model revealed the trade-oﬀs between sensitivity, turnaround time, and false-positive rate of the SARS-CoV-2 SCAN. With preampliﬁcation and a 30 min CRISPR Cas12a assay, we achieved excellent speciﬁcity against other common human coronaviruses and a limit of detection of 13.5 copies/μL (22.5 aM) of viral RNA at a conﬁdence level of 95\%. These results suggested that the SCAN could provide a rapid, sensitive, and speciﬁc analysis of SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {The mechanical behavior of individual cells plays an important role in regulating various biological activities at the molecular and cellular levels. It can serve as a promising label-free marker of cells’ physiological states. In the past two decades, several techniques have been developed for understanding correlations between cellular mechanical changes and human diseases. However, numerous technical challenges remain with regard to realizing high-throughput, robust, and easy-to-perform measurements of single-cell mechanical properties. In this paper, we review the emerging tools for single-cell mechanical characterization that are provided by microfluidic technology. Different techniques are benchmarked by considering their advantages and limitations. Finally, the potential applications of microfluidic techniques based on cellular mechanical properties are discussed.},

	abstract = {Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) could be underdiagnosed and underreported due to the delayed onset of symptoms and the conventional subjective assessment. Recent studies have suggested that salivary microRNAs (miRNAs) could be reliable biomarkers for objective mTBI diagnosis. In this work, we demonstrated a rolling circle ampliﬁcation (RCA)-coupled resistive pulse-counting platform for proﬁling mTBI-related miRNAs, using easy-to-fabricate large glass nanopores (200 nm diameter). The method relies on the linear and speciﬁc elongation of the miRNA to a much larger RCA product, which the large glass nanopore can digitally count with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We developed and validated the RCA assay against let-7a, miR-30e, and miR-21. We demonstrated the quantiﬁcation capability of this large glass nanopore counting platform for puriﬁed miRNAs as well as miRNAs in salivary total RNA background. Finally, we quantitatively evaluated the performance of proﬁling each individual miRNAs in a mixed analyte. Our results showed that the RCA-coupled large glass nanopore counting provides a promising and accessible alternative toward the clinical diagnosis of mTBI using salivary miRNAs.},

	abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based nucleic acid-sensing systems have grown rapidly in the past few years. Nevertheless, an objective approach to benchmark the performances of diﬀerent CRISPR sensing systems is lacking due to the heterogeneous experimental setup. Here, we developed a quantitative CRISPR sensing ﬁgure of merit (FOM) to compare diﬀerent CRISPR methods and explore performance improvement strategies. The CRISPR sensing FOM is deﬁned as the product of the limit of detection (LOD) and the associated CRISPR reaction time (T). A smaller FOM means that the method can detect smaller target quantities faster. We found that there is a tradeoﬀ between the LOD of the assay and the required reaction time. With the proposed CRISPR sensing FOM, we evaluated ﬁve strategies to improve the CRISPR-based sensing: preampliﬁcation, enzymes of higher catalytic eﬃciency, multiple crRNAs, digitalization, and sensitive readout systems. We benchmarked the FOM performances of 57 existing studies and found that the eﬀectiveness of these strategies on improving the FOM is consistent with the model prediction. In particular, we found that digitalization is the most promising ampliﬁcation-free method for achieving comparable FOM performances (∼1 fM·min) as those using preampliﬁcation. The ﬁndings here would have broad implications for further optimization of the CRISPR-based sensing.},
