	abstract = {Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has revolutionized diagnostics by providing precise, rapid, and scalable detection methods for diverse biological samples. These recent advancements satisfy the increasing demand for on-site diagnostics, yet sample preparation remains a significant bottleneck for achieving highly sensitive diagnostic assays. There is an unmet need for compatible, efficient, and lab-free sample preparation for point-of-care NAT. To address this, we developed a portable, lab-free, and battery-powered device for extracting nucleic acids. We explored using low centrifugal forces with existing commercial chemistry, demonstrating excellent performance. We designed and tested a battery-powered device to enable lab-free extractions, and verified reagents stored out to 6 months, suggesting exceptional deployment capabilities. We evaluated our device, comparing our results against those from a benchtop centrifuge across three types of samples: HIV RNA in buffer, HIV RNA in plasma, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. The portable device demonstrated excellent agreement with the benchtop centrifuge, indicating high reliability. By providing an effective on-site sample preparation solution, the widespread adoption of low centrifugal extractions will improve the sensitivity and reliability of NAT and will positively impact other point-of-care technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), biomarker detection, and environmental monitoring. This method utilizes a low-power, portable centrifuge to significantly improve the deployment of nucleic acid extractions. As a result, this method offers comparable extraction performance to benchtop devices while offering superior portability and ease of use. Minimizing centrifugal force allows for reliable nucleic acid extraction from a low-power device. Our approach is simple and uses low-cost electronics, presenting high potential for clinical preparation of RNA in field settings. Sample preparation continues to be a major bottleneck for sensitive diagnostic assays.We developed a portable, lab-free, and battery-powered device for extracting nucleic acids.We demonstrated that a commercial extraction kit could be processed at low centrifugal forces, enabling point-of-care development.We designed a battery-powered, semi-automated centrifuge that rivaled a benchtop centrifuge in performance and efficiency.Reagents remained stable for 6 months and extractions were robust without carrier RNA.Our device offers an effective on-site sample preparation solution that enhances NAT sensitivity and reliability while maintaining compatibility with commercial chemistry.Consequently, our portable centrifuge is well-positioned to impact other point-of-care applications like NGS, biomarker detection, and environmental monitoring.

	abstract = {Solid-state nanopores, known for their label-free detection and operational simplicity, face challenges in accurately sizing the short nucleic acids due to fast translocation and a lack of enzyme-based control mechanisms as compared to their biological counterparts with sizing resolutions still limited to ≥100 bp. Here, we present a facile polyethylene glycol-dimethacrylate (PEG-DMA) hydrogel interfaced glass nanopore (HIGN) system by inserting glass nanopore into the hydrogel to achieve sub-100 base pair (bp) resolution in short DNA sizing analysis. We systematically investigated the effects of hydrogel mesh size, spatial configurations of glass nanopores about the hydrogel, applied bias voltage, and analyte concentration on the transport dynamics of 200 bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). A 7.5 w/v\% PEG-DMA hydrogel induced ∼11x increase in the mean dwell times compared with bare solution nanopore system. The insertion locations and depths of the glass nanopore into the hydrogel resulted in 7.16\% and 5.28\% coefficients of variation (CV) for mean normalized event frequencies. This enhancement of dwell times and invariability in translocation characteristics enables precise sizing of dsDNA fragments under 400 bp using HIGN, with an achieved size resolution of 50 bp with observable mean normalized peak amplitude (ΔI/Io) of ∼0.005. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the capability of HIGN to perform multiplex detection of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These results demonstrated the potential of HIGN as a versatile tool in nucleic acid analysis and multiplexed label-free molecular diagnostics.},

	abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a major global health concern for which accurate viral load monitoring is essential for the management of HIV infection. The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed once-fatal HIV disease into a manageable chronic condition that now makes the need for VL testing which aims to satisfy international suppression targets 95-95-95 al l the more essential. Therefore, considering the complexity and diversity of HIV infection, it is essential to develop rapid diagnostic technologies suitable for different clinical situations. Here, we report on a multiplexed PCR device developed for simple and efficient quantification of HIV-1 or HIV-2 viral loads using finger-pricked whole blood from rural decentralized settings. This device is comprised of a previously developed RNA extraction module combined with an optimized real-time PCR amplification system. Together, these combine to simultaneously detect and differentiate HIV-1 \& 2; as well are adopting a testing control of RNase P allowing for full diagnostic analysis from one sample. Our device also includes an intuitive user interface and is completely autonomous so it can serve individuals in remote areas who are unfamiliar with the field of medical testing. They get the results in a very short time of around 70 min and hence save on testing times without leaving accuracy behind. The efficiency and effectiveness of the device were validated through the analysis of 30 clinical samples, yielding a sensitivity of 100\% for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The specificity was found to be 100\% for HIV-1 and 90.91\% for HIV-2, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy. One of the most attractive things about this device is that it comes in comparison to all other counterparts. Given that you can run the assay for less than \$10, it could be an economically viable way to use this as a broadscale test in regions where healthcare budgets don't allow others. Hence it is quite a useful device to aid HIV management in resource-limited settings, where conventional laboratory facilities are out of reach due its simplicity and affordability with rapid output. The point-of-care test is an effective, low-cost, high quality diagnostic tool-promoting rapid testing for HIV-inexpensively overcoming the barriers to efficient control of and care in resource-limited settings.},

	abstract = {There is a significant demand for multiplexed fluorescence sensing and detection across a range of applications. Yet, the development of portable and compact multiplexable systems remains a substantial challenge. This difficulty largely stems from the inherent need for spectrum separation, which typically requires sophisticated and expensive optical components. Here, we demonstrate a compact, lens-free, and cost-effective fluorescence sensing setup that incorporates machine learning for scalable multiplexed fluorescence detection. This method utilizes low-cost optical components and a pretrained machine learning (ML) model to enable multiplexed fluorescence sensing without optical adjustments. Its multiplexing capability can be easily scaled up through updates to the machine learning model without altering the hardware. We demonstrate its real-world application in a probe-based multiplexed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay designed to simultaneously detect three common respiratory viruses within a single reaction. The effectiveness of this approach highlights the system’s potential for point-of-care applications that require cost-effective and scalable solutions. The machine learning-enabled multiplexed fluorescence sensing demonstrated in this work would pave the way for widespread adoption in diverse settings, from clinical laboratories to field diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Regular, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive self-testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is urgently needed to quell pandemic propagation. The existing at-home nucleic acid testing (NAT) test has high sensitivity and specificity, but it requires users to mail the sample to the central lab, which often takes 3−5 days to obtain the results. On the other hand, rapid antigen tests for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen provide a fast sample to answer the test (15 min). However, the sensitivity of antigen tests is 30 to 40\% lower than nucleic acid testing, which could miss a significant portion of infected patients. Here, we developed a fully integrated SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) device using a self-collected saliva sample. This platform can automatically handle the complexity and can perform the functions, including (1) virus particles’ thermal lysis preparation, (2) sample dispensing, (3) target sequence RT-LAMP amplification, (4) real-time detection, and (5) result report and communication. With a turnaround time of less than 45 min, our device achieved the limit of detection (LoD) of 5 copies/μL of the saliva sample, which is comparable with the LoD (6 copies/μL) using FDA-approved quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays with the same heat-lysis saliva sample preparation method. With clinical samples, our platform showed a good agreement with the results from the gold-standard RT-PCR method. These results show that our platform can perform self-administrated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by laypersons with noninvasive saliva samples. We believe that our self-testing platform will have an ongoing benefit for COVID-19 control and fighting future pandemics.},

	abstract = {HIV self-testing is an emerging innovative approach that allows individuals who want to know their HIV status to collect their own specimen, perform a test, and interpret the results privately. Existing HIV self-testing methods rely on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect the presence of HIV-1/2 antibodies, which could miss a significant portion of asymptomatic carriers during the window period. In this work, we present a fully integrated nucleic acid testing (NAT) device towards streamlined HIV self-testing using 100 μL finger-prick whole blood. The device consists of a ready-to-use microfluidic reagent cartridge and an ultra-compact NAT-on-USB analyzer. The test requires simple steps from the user to drop the finger-prick blood sample into a collection tube with lysis buffer and load the lysate onto the microfluidic cartridge, and the testing result can be easily read out by a custom-built graphical user interface (GUI). The microfluidic cartridge and the analyzer automatically handle the complexity of sample preparation, purification, and real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). With a turnaround time of {\textasciitilde}60 min, we achieved a limit of detection (LoD) of 214 viral RNA copies/ mL of whole blood at a 95\% confidence level. Due to its ease of use and high sensitivity, we anticipate the HIV NAT-on-USB device would be particularly useful for the high-risk populations seeking private self-testing at the early stages of exposure.},

Rapid and accurate testing of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed for early detection and control of the disease spread. Here, we present an RT-LAMP coupled glass nanopore digital counting method for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. We validated and compared two one-pot RT-LAMP assays targeting nucleocapsid (N) and envelop (E) genes. The nucleocapsid assay was adopted due to its quick time to positive and better copy number sensitivity. For qualitative positive/negative classification of a testing sample, we used the glass nanopore to digitally count the RT-LAMP amplicons and benchmarked the event rate with a threshold. Due to its intrinsic single molecule sensitivity, nanopore sensors could capture the amplification dynamics more rapidly (quick time to positive). We validated our RT-LAMP coupled glass nanopore digital counting method for SARS-CoV-2 detection by using both spiked saliva samples and COVID-19 clinical naso­ pharyngeal swab samples. The results obtained showed excellent agreement with the gold standard RT-PCR assay. With its integration capability, the electronic nanopore digital counting platform has significant poten­ tial to provide a rapid, sensitive, and specific point-of-care assay for SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {Laser-assisted controlled dielectric breakdown (LaCBD) has emerged as an alternative to conventional CBD-based nanopore fabrication due to its localization capability, facilitated by the photothermal-induced thinning down in the hot spot. Here, we reported the potential impact of the laser on forming debris around the nanopore region in LaCBD. The debris was clearly observable by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. We found that debris formation is a unique phenomenon in LaCBD that is not observable in the conventional CBD approach. We also found that the LaCBD-induced debris is more evident when the laser power and voltage stress are higher. Moreover, the debris is asymmetrically distributed on the top and bottom sides of the membrane. We also found unexpected rectified ionic and molecular transport in those LaCBD nanopores with debris. Based on these observations, we developed and validated a model describing the debris formation kinetics in LaCBD by considering the generation, diffusion, drift, and gravity in viscous mediums. These findings indicate that while laser aids in nanopore localization, precautions should be taken due to the potential formation of debris and rectification of molecular transport. This study provides valuable insights into the kinetics of LaCBD and the characteristics of the LaCBD nanopore.},

	abstract = {Quantification of HIV RNA in plasma is critical for identifying the disease progression and monitoring the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. While RT-qPCR has been the gold standard for HIV viral load quantification, digital assays could provide an alternative calibration-free absolute quantification method. Here, we reported a Self-digitization Through Automated Membrane-based Partitioning (STAMP) method to digitalize the CRISPR-Cas13 assay (dCRISPR) for amplification-free and absolute quantification of HIV-1 viral RNAs. The HIV-1 Cas13 assay was designed, validated, and optimized. We evaluated the analytical performances with synthetic RNAs. With a membrane that partitions ∼100 nL of reaction mixture (effectively containing 10 nL of input RNA sample), we showed that RNA samples spanning 4 orders of dynamic range between 1 fM (∼6 RNAs) to 10 pM (∼60k RNAs) could be quantified as fast as 30 min. We also examined the end-to-end performance from RNA extraction to STAMP-dCRISPR quantification using 140 μL of both spiked and clinical plasma samples. We demonstrated that the device has a detection limit of approximately 2000 copies/mL and can resolve a viral load change of 3571 copies/mL (equivalent to 3 RNAs in a single membrane) with 90\% confidence. Finally, we evaluated the device using 140 μL of 20 patient plasma samples (10 positives and 10 negatives) and benchmarked the performance with RT-PCR. The STAMP-dCRISPR results agree very well with RT-PCR for all negative and high positive samples with Ct {\textless} 32. However, the STAMP-dCRISPR is limited in detecting low positive samples with Ct {\textgreater} 32 due to the subsampling errors. Our results demonstrated a digital Cas13 platform that could offer an accessible amplificationfree quantification of viral RNAs. By further addressing the subsampling issue with approaches such as preconcentration, this platform could be further exploited for quantitatively determining viral load for an array of infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant problem to consider as it can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Fortunately, AIDS is manageable through antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, frequent viral load monitoring is needed to monitor the effectiveness of the therapy. The current reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) viral load monitoring is highly effective, but is challenged by being resource-intensive and inaccessible, and its turnaround time does not meet demand. An unmet need exists for an affordable, rapid, and user-friendly point-of-care device that could revolutionize and ensure therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in resource-limited settings. In this work, we explored a pointof-care HIV viral load device to address this need. This device can perform streamlined plasma separation, viral RNA extraction, and real-time reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) semiquantitative testing in an ultracompact device. We developed an absorption-based membrane plasma separation method suitable for finger-prick blood samples, achieving an efficiency of 80\%. We also designed a syringe-based RNA extraction method for on-site plasma processing with a viral recovery efficiency of 86\%. We created a portable device with a smartphone interface for real-time semiquantitative RT-LAMP, which is useful for monitoring viral load. The device uses lyophilized reagents, processed with our lyophilization method, which remain stable for 16 weeks. The device can accurately categorize viral load into low, medium, and high categories with 95\% accuracy. We believe this point-of-care HIV self-test device, offering convenience and longterm storage, could aid patients in home-based ART treatment monitoring.},

We used a simple two-reagent-based purification-free protocol to prepare the whole blood sample on a piezo pump pressure-driven microfluidic cartridge. The cartridge includes a unique mixing chamber for sample preparation and metering structures to dispense a predetermined volume of the sample lysate mixture into four chambers containing a reaction mix. The parasite genomic DNA concentration can be estimated by monitoring the fluorescence generated from the loopmediated isothermal amplification reaction in real time. We achieved a sensitivity of ∼0.42 parasite/μL of whole blood, sufficient for detecting asymptomatic malaria parasite carriers.},

	abstract = {In developing solid-state nanopore sensors for single molecule detection, comprehensive evaluation of the nanopore quality is important. Existing studies typically rely on comparing the noise root mean square or power spectrum density values. Nanopores exhibiting lower noise values are generally considered superior. This evaluation is valid when the single molecule signal remains consistent. However, the signal can vary, as it is strongly related to the solid-state nanopore size, which is hard to control during fabrication consistently. This work emphasized the need to report the baseline current for evaluating solid-state nanopore sensors. The baseline current offers insight into several experimental conditions, particularly the nanopore size. Our experiments show that a nanopore sensor with more noise is not necessarily worse when considering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), particularly when the pore size is smaller. Our findings suggest that relying only on noise comparisons can lead to inaccurate evaluations of solid-state nanopore sensors, considering the inherent variability in fabrication and testing setups among labs and measurements. We propose that future studies should include reporting baseline current and sensing conditions. Additionally, using SNR as a primary evaluation tool for nanopore sensors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their performance.},

	abstract = {Point-of-care testing (POCT) of blood cell count (BCC) is an emerging approach that allows laypersons to identify and count whole blood cells through simple manipulation. To date, POCTs for BCC were mainly achieved by “stationary” images through blood smears or single-laity arranged cells in the microwell, making it difficult to obtain statistically sufficient numbers of cells. In this work, we present a fully integrated POCT device solely using “in-flow” imaging of 3 μL fingertip whole blood for improved identification and counting accuracy of BCC analysis. A miniaturized magnetic stirring module was integrated to maintain the temporal stability of cell concentration. A relatively high throughput ({\textasciitilde}8000 cells/min) with a 30-fold dilution ratio of whole blood can be tested for as long as 1 h to examine sufficient numbers of cells, and the subclass cell concentration keeps constant. To improve the identification accuracy, multi-frame “in-flow” imaging was used to track the cell motion trails with multi-angle morphology analysis. This proof-of-concept was then validated with healthy whole blood samples and 75 cases of clinical patients with abnormal concentrations of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLT). The average precision (AP) value of WBCs identification was improved from 0.8622 to 0.9934 using the multi-frame analysis method. And the high fitting degrees ({\textgreater}0.98) between our POCT device and the commercial clinical equipment indicated good agreement. This POCT device is user-friendly and cost-effective, making it a potential tool for diagnosing abnormal blood cell morphology or concentration in the field setting.},

          , 
            
              Upstream sample preparation remains the bottleneck for point-of-need nucleic acid testing due to its complexity and time-consuming nature. Sample preparation involves extracting, purifying, and concentrating nucleic acids from various matrices. These processes are critical for ensuring the accuracy and sensitivity of downstream nucleic acid amplification and detection. However, current sample preparation methods are often laboratory-based, requiring specialized equipment, trained personnel, and several hours of processing time. As a result, sample preparation often limits the speed, portability, and cost-effectiveness of point-of-need nucleic acid testing. A universal, field-deployable sample preparation device is highly desirable for this critical need and unmet challenge. Here we reported a handheld, battery-powered, reconfigurable, and field-deployable nucleic acid sample preparation device. A programmable electromagnetic actuator was developed to drive a magnetic robot (ProMagBot) in
              X
              /
              Y
              2D space, such that various magnetic bead-based sample preparations can be readily translated from the laboratory to point-of-need settings. The control of the electromagnetic actuator requires only a 3-phase unipolar voltage in
              X
              and
              Y
              directions, and therefore, the motion space is highly scalable. We validated the ProMagBot device with a model application by extracting HIV viral RNAs from plasma samples using two widely used magnetic bead kits: ChargeSwitch and MagMAX beads. In both cases, the ProMagBot could successfully extract viral RNAs from 50 μL plasma samples containing as low as 10
              2
              copies of viral RNAs in 20 minutes. Our results demonstrated the ability of ProMagBot to prepare samples from complex mediums at the point of need. We believe such a device would enable rapid and robust sample preparation in various settings, including resource-limited or remote environments, and accelerate the development of next-generation point-of-need nucleic acid testing.},

Yet, LAMP can suffer from the issue of false positives, which can compromise the specificity of the results. LAMP false positives typically arise due to contamination, nonspecific amplification, and nonspecific signal reporting (intercalating dyes, colorimetric, turbidity, etc.). While dye-labeled primers or probes have been introduced for multiplexed detection and enhanced specificity in LAMP assays, they carry the risk of reaction inhibition. This inhibition can result from the labeled primers with fluorophores or quenchers and probes that do not fully dissociate during reaction. This work demonstrated a nanopore-based system for probe-free LAMP readouts by employing amplicon sizing and counting, analogous to an electronic version of gel electrophoresis. We first developed a model to explore LAMP kinetics and verified distinct patterns between true and false positives via gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, we implemented nanopore sized counting and calibrated the event charge deficit (ECD) values and frequencies to ensure a fair analysis of amplicon profiles. This sized counting method, integrated with machine learning, achieved 91.67\% accuracy for false positive discrimination, enhancing LAMP’s reliability for nucleic acid detection.},

            Solid‐state nanopore sensors, a type of resistive pulse sensing, achieve optimal signal‐to‐noise performance with a single nanopore. However, the processes involved in solid‐state nanopore fabrication and subsequent measurements frequently lead to the formation of multiple nanopores, posing a challenge for precise detection. To address this issue, here, a novel and expedient technique to verify the presence of a single nanopore on a chip is developed. The methodology includes measuring the nanopore's conductance in solutions of various salt conditions, followed by a comparison of these results against a theoretical conductance model. This comparison is instrumental in distinguishing between single and multiple nanopores. Additionally, the study delves into various factors that influence the conductance curve, such as deviations in pore shape from the standard circle and inconsistencies in pore diameter. This approach significantly enhances the practical application of low‐cost nanopore preparation techniques, particularly in scenarios like controlled breakdown nanopore fabrication, where the formation of multiple nanopores is a common concern.},

The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) tech­ nique has emerged as a promising next-generation molecular diagnostic approach. Here, we developed a highly sensitive and specific CRISPR-Cas12a assisted nanopore (SCAN) with isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for MPXV detection. The RPA-SCAN method offers a sensitivity unachievable with unam­ plified SCAN while also addressing the obstacles of PCR-SCAN for point-of-care applications. We demonstrated that size-counting of single molecules enables analysis of reaction-time dependent distribution of the cleaved reporter. Our MPXV-specific RPA assay achieved a limit of detection (LoD) of 19 copies in a 50 μL reaction system. By integrating 2 μL of RPA amplifications into a 20 μL CRISPR reaction, we attained an overall LoD of 16 copies/μL (26.56 aM) of MPXV at a 95\% confidence level using the SCAN sensor. We also verified the specificity of RPA-SCAN in distinguishing MPXV from cowpox virus with 100\% accuracy. These findings suggest that the isothermal RPA-SCAN device is well-suited for highly sensitive and specific Monkeypox detection. Given its electronic nature and miniaturization potential, the RPA-SCAN system paves the way for diagnosing a wide array of other infectious pathogens at the point of care.},

	abstract = {The resistive switching characteristics and switching mechanisms of the Au-implanted-ZrO2 film are extensively investigated for nonvolatile memory applications. Reversible resistance-switching behavior from a high resistance to low resistance state can be traced by dc voltage and pulse voltage. After more than 200 dc switching cycles, the resistance ratio between the high and low resistance states is more than 180 times under 0.7 V readout bias. In the voltage pulse test, the “write” and “erase” speeds can be as fast as 50 and 100 ns, respectively. No data loss is observed for more than 106 s. The formation and rupture of conducting filamentary paths related to the implanted Au ions are suggested to be responsible for the resistive switching phenomenon. The dependence of resistance on temperature indicates that the variable-range hopping conduction mechanism is dominated in the low-resistance state, while the current characteristics are governed by the trap-controlled space limited conduction mechanism in the high-resistance state.},

The hybrid MOS, however, shows a larger memory window, as compared with RTA MOS. The retention characteristics of the two MOS devices are also investigated.

Through this method, Si nanocrystals with high density and self-limited size distribution can be obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that the Er-induced nanocrystalline silicon film has good charge storage characteristics.

We investigated (i) a ﬂexible bonded string of charged beads and (ii) a ssDNA polymer of variable length, for various trap parameters. A line charge undergoes oscillations or rotations as it moves, depending on its initial angle, the position of the center of mass and the velocity. The stability region for a strongly bonded line of charged beads is similar to that of a single ion with the same charge to mass ratio. Single stranded DNA as long as 40 nm does not fold or curl in the Paul trap, but could undergo rotations about the center of mass. However, we show that a stretching ﬁeld in the axial direction can effectively prevent the rotations and increase the conﬁnement stability.},

              We present a continuous-flow droplet-based digital Enzyme-Linked Oligonucleotide Hybridization Assay (droplet digital ELOHA) for sensitive detection and absolute quantification of RNA molecules. Droplet digital ELOHA incorporates direct hybridization and single enzyme reaction via the formation of single probe-RNA-probe (enzyme) complex on magnetic beads. It enables RNA detection without reverse transcription and PCR amplification processes. The magnetic beads are subsequently encapsulated into a large number of picoliter-sized droplets with enzyme substrates in a continuous-flow device. This device is capable of generating droplets at high-throughput. It also integrates in-line enzymatic incubation and detection of fluorescent products. Our droplet digital ELOHA is able to accurately quantify (differentiate 40\% difference) as few as {\textasciitilde}600 RNA molecules in a 1 mL sample (equivalent to 1 aM or lower) without molecular replication. The absolute quantification ability of droplet digital ELOHA is demonstrated with the analysis of clinical

              16S rRNA to show its potential value in real complex samples.},

          , 
            
              In response to the urgent need of a field-deployable and highly sensitive malaria diagnosis, we developed a standalone, “sample-in-answer-out” molecular diagnostic system (AnyMDx) to enable quantitative molecular analysis of blood-borne malaria in low resource areas. The system consists of a durable battery-powered analyzer and a disposable microfluidic compact disc loaded with reagents ready for use. A low power thermal module and a novel fluorescence-sensing module are integrated into the analyzer for real-time monitoring of loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) of target parasite DNA. With 10 μL of raw blood sample, the AnyMDx system automates the nucleic acid sample preparation and subsequent LAMP and real-time detection. Under laboratory conditions with whole-blood samples spiked with cultured
              Plasmodium falciparum
              , we achieved a detection limit of ∼0.6 parasite per μL, much lower than those for the conventional microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (∼50–100 parasites per μL). The turnaround time from sample to answer is less than 40 minutes. The AnyMDx is user-friendly requiring minimal technological training. The analyzer and the disposable reagent compact discs are cost-effective, making AnyMDx a potential tool for malaria molecular diagnosis under field settings for malaria elimination.},

The cell deformability is measured by evaluating the transit time when each individual RBC squeezes through a microscale constriction (cross-section {\textasciitilde}5 µm×5 µm). More than 30,000 RBCs can be analyzed for parasitemia quantiﬁcation in under 1 min with a throughput {\textasciitilde}500 cells/s.

Using Pf-iRBCs at 0.1\% parasitemia as a testing sample, the microﬂuidic deformability sensor achieved an excellent sensitivity (94.29\%), speciﬁcity (86.67\%) and accuracy (92.00\%) in a blind test, comparable to the gold standard of the blood smear microscopy. As a supplement technology to the microscopy and ﬂow cytometry, the microﬂuidic deformability sensor would possibly allow for label-free, rapid and costeﬀective parasitemia quantiﬁcation and stage determination for malaria in remote regions.},

Here, kirigami‐based concepts that enable ultraflexible thin film OLEDs to be cut, folded, and “popped up” into a variety of 3D shapes ranging from globes to candle flame mimics are used.

In this work, we proposed and validated a calibration-free nanopore single molecule digital counting method for isolated molecule quantiﬁcation. With the background ions as the in situ references, the molecule translocation rates can be normalized to the ion translocation rates (i.e., baseline current). This in situ reference alleviates the requirement for knowing the nanopore geometry and size or generating a calibration curve. In recognition of this eﬀect, we developed a quantitative model for nanopore quantiﬁcation without the need for prior knowledge of experimental conditions such as nanopore geometry, size, and applied voltage. This model was experimentally validated for diﬀerent nanopores and DNA molecules with diﬀerent sizes. We anticipate this calibration-free digital counting approach would provide a new avenue for nanopore-based molecule sensing.},

In this work, we systematically studied the experimental factors beyond the intrinsic analyte concentration and electrophoretic mobility that aﬀect the event rate in glass nanopore sensors. We developed a quantitative model to capture the impact of nanopore surface charge density, ionic strength, nanopore geometry, and translocation direction on the event rate. The synergistic eﬀects of these factors on the event rates were investigated with the aim to ﬁnd the optimized experimental conditions for operating the glass nanopore sensor from the response time standpoint.

In response, by combining the time-division multiple access technique in the telecommunication ﬁeld with the microﬂuidics, we reported a microﬂuidic time-division multiplexing accessing (TDMA) singleend resistive pulse sensor, in which particles can be analyzed through a scalable number of microﬂuidic channels.

Here, we demonstrate a novel loopmediated isothermal ampliﬁcation (LAMP)-coupled glass nanopore counting strategy that could eﬀectively address these challenges. By using the glass nanopore in the counting mode (versus the sizing mode), the device fabrication challenge is considerably eased since it allows a certain degree of pore size variations and no surface functionalization is needed. The speciﬁc molecule replication eﬀectively breaks the diﬀusion-limited mass transport thanks to the exponential growth of the target molecules. We show the LAMPcoupled glass nanopore counting has the potential to be used in a qualitative test as well as in a quantitative nucleic acid test. This approach lends itself to most ampliﬁcation strategies as long as the target template is speciﬁcally replicated in numbers.

Here, we demonstrated the ﬁrst single-particle-resolved, cytometry-like deformability-activated sorting in the continuous ﬂow on a microﬂuidic chip. Compared with existing deformability-based sorting techniques, the microﬂuidic device presented in this work measures the deformability and immediately sorts the particles one-by-one in real time. It integrates the transit-time-based deformability measurement and active hydrodynamic sorting onto a single chip. We identiﬁed the critical factors that affect the sorting dynamics by modeling and experimental approaches. We found that the device throughput is determined by the summation of the sensing, buffering, and sorting time. A total time of {\textasciitilde}100 ms is used for analyzing and sorting a single particle, leading to a throughput of 600 particles/min. We synthesized poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel beads as the deformability model for device validation and performance evaluation. A deformability-activated sorting purity of 88\% and an average efﬁciency of 73\% were achieved. We anticipate that the ability to actively measure and sort individual particles one-byone in a continuous ﬂow would ﬁnd applications in cell-mechanotyping studies such as correlational studies of the cell mechanical phenotype and molecular mechanism.},

	abstract = {Focused electron and laser beams have shown the ability to form nanoscale pores in SiNx membranes. During the fabrication process, areas beyond the final nanopore location will inevitably be exposed to the electron beams or the laser beams due to the need for localization, alignment and focus. It remains unclear how these unintended exposures affect the integrity of the membrane. In this work, we demonstrate the use of confocal scanning photoluminescence (PL) for mapping the microscopic changes in SiNx nanopores when exposed to electron and laser beams. We developed and validated a model for the quantitative interpretation of the scanned PL result. The model shows that the scanning PL result is insensitive to the nanopore size. Instead, it is dominated by the product of two microscopic material factors: quantum yield profile (i.e. variations in electronic structure) and thickness profile (i.e. thinning of the membrane). We experimentally demonstrated that the electron and laser beams could alter the material electronic structures (i.e. quantum yield) even when no thinning of the membrane occurs. Our results suggest that minimizing the unintended e-beam or laser beam to the SiNx during the fabrication is crucial if one desires the microscopic integrity of the membrane.},

Since the ﬁrst α-hemolysin biological nanopore, various types of nanopores made of different materials have been under extensive development. Noise represents a common challenge among all types of nanopore sensors. The nanopore noise can be decomposed into four components in the frequency domain (1/f noise, white noise, dielectric noise, and ampliﬁer noise). In this work, we reviewed and summarized the physical models, origins, and reduction methods for each of these noise components. For the ﬁrst time, we quantitatively benchmarked the root mean square (RMS) noise levels for different types of nanopores, demonstrating a clear material-dependent RMS noise. We anticipate this review article will enhance the understanding of nanopore sensor noises and provide an informative tutorial for developing future nanopore sensors with a high signal-to-noise ratio.},

Several prior studies have shown that laser-assisted dielectric breakdown could help control the nanopore position and reduce the possibility of forming multiple pores. Here, we developed a physical model to estimate the probability of forming a single nanopore under diﬀerent combinations of the laser power and the electric ﬁeld. This model relies on the material- and experimentspeciﬁc parameters: the Weibull statistical parameters and the laser-induced photothermal etching rate. Both the model and our experimental data suggest that a combination of a high laser power and a low electric ﬁeld is statistically favorable for forming a single nanopore at a programmed location. While this model relies on experiment-speciﬁc parameters, we anticipate it could provide the experimental insights for nanopore fabrication by the laser-assisted dielectric breakdown method, enabling broader access to solid-state nanopores and their sensing applications.},

We developed a quantitative model to capture the impact of nanochannel surface charge, gating voltage and frequency, molecule diffusivity, and gating electrode geometry on the transport and separation efﬁciency.

We introduced a nanopore-sized counting method to measure the cleavage ratio of reporters, which is used as a criterion for positive/negative classiﬁcation. A kinetic cleavage model was developed and validated to predict the reporter size distributions. The model revealed the trade-oﬀs between sensitivity, turnaround time, and false-positive rate of the SARS-CoV-2 SCAN. With preampliﬁcation and a 30 min CRISPR Cas12a assay, we achieved excellent speciﬁcity against other common human coronaviruses and a limit of detection of 13.5 copies/μL (22.5 aM) of viral RNA at a conﬁdence level of 95\%.

The method relies on the linear and speciﬁc elongation of the miRNA to a much larger RCA product, which the large glass nanopore can digitally count with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We developed and validated the RCA assay against let-7a, miR-30e, and miR-21. We demonstrated the quantiﬁcation capability of this large glass nanopore counting platform for puriﬁed miRNAs as well as miRNAs in salivary total RNA background. Finally, we quantitatively evaluated the performance of proﬁling each individual miRNAs in a mixed analyte. Our results showed that the RCA-coupled large glass nanopore counting provides a promising and accessible alternative toward the clinical diagnosis of mTBI using salivary miRNAs.},

	abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based nucleic acid-sensing systems have grown rapidly in the past few years. Nevertheless, an objective approach to benchmark the performances of diﬀerent CRISPR sensing systems is lacking due to the heterogeneous experimental setup. Here, we developed a quantitative CRISPR sensing ﬁgure of merit (FOM) to compare diﬀerent CRISPR methods and explore performance improvement strategies. The CRISPR sensing FOM is deﬁned as the product of the limit of detection (LOD) and the associated CRISPR reaction time (T). A smaller FOM means that the method can detect smaller target quantities faster. We found that there is a tradeoﬀ between the LOD of the assay and the required reaction time. With the proposed CRISPR sensing FOM, we evaluated ﬁve strategies to improve the CRISPR-based sensing: preampliﬁcation, enzymes of higher catalytic eﬃciency, multiple crRNAs, digitalization, and sensitive readout systems. We benchmarked the FOM performances of 57 existing studies and found that the eﬀectiveness of these strategies on improving the FOM is consistent with the model prediction. In particular, we found that digitalization is the most promising ampliﬁcation-free method for achieving comparable FOM performances (∼1 fM·min) as those using preampliﬁcation. The ﬁndings here would have broad implications for further optimization of the CRISPR-based sensing.},
